# Datascience-chatbot

In the IAB Data Science Instructor Bot, I have used the OpenAI's GPT-3 language model 
to create a conversational chatbot that you can interact with and ask data science related question.
The final product runs on a streamlit interface.


To try it, clone my repository

Install the OpenAI package by running:
pip install openai

Also install streamlit:
pip install streamlit

In order to use the GPT-3 model, you will need need an API key from OpenAI. 

follow the following steps o get your API Key.

Once gotten, paste it in the blank space where it read "YOUR OPENAI API KEY".

Then, run the code below

streamlit run chatbot.py

this will load in your default browser and you can have a chat with the IAB Data Science Bot.


Cheers!!!!
